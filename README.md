## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Create, Read, Update, and Delete markdown documents
- Name and save documents to be accessed as needed
- Edit the markdown of a document and see the formatted preview of the content
- View a full-page preview of the formatted content
- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: If you're building a purely front-end project, use localStorage to save the current state in the browser that persists when the browser is refreshed
